# ypbot2

YPBot's backend from ConUHacks rewritten with Node.js.

This is a simplified implementation of the original code; the bot replies the user with the number of results found.

In short, the bot uses Yellow Pages API in order to fufill search queries from users tweeting from a specific hashtag. The bot was originally setup to reply the user with nearby merchants that is selling the item they have requested.
